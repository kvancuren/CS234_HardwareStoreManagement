Stage 2: Hardware Store

I worked on all of the manager's stuff. I worked on manager, sales, reports, employees, inventory, items, schedule, and setting up the menu.

Depending on whether the employee uses a managers number or a regular employees number will determine if they get the other options. 
The regular employees will get to see things like customers, checkout, see their schedule, and look up items and see where they are. 

The manager will have the option to print reports, look at inventory, sales, and create the employee schedule, and get to change the prices of items. 
The manager can go in and change employee and customer information and change any other data in the system.
